**General Information**
This coursework is summative, meaning that the mark you obtain contributes to your final mark for the module. You will receive basic feedback about which answers are correct and which are wrong together with an overall grade; however, this feedback will be delayed until at least two weeks after the submission deadline, to ensure that all students (even those who submitted an MCF and consequently obtained an extension) have submitted before the feedback is provided.

College regulations do not allow for extensions to be granted to individual students by module lecturers. To obtain an extension, you will need to submit a Mitigating Circumstances Form (MCF) together with evidence as to the reasons why you are requesting an extension. The procedure for submitting a MCF is described in your student handbook.

If you need clarification on the instructions, then please ask via the KEATS forum. Any suggestions as to how to make the instructions clearer are also most welcome. However, it is not appropriate to ask for help on how to answer a question: this is an assessment, and like other assessments (such as an exam) it is not appropriate to ask someone else to help you to answer a question.

You do not need to complete this coursework in one go. You can leave KEATS and return at a later time and continue from where you left off.

You have one attempt at this quiz: once you submit your answers you cannot go back and alter them.

In general, for numerical values that are non-integer real numbers, it is necessary to provide answers correct to at least 2 decimal places, which means that calculations should be performed with a precision of at least 4 decimal places. For example, if you are asked to report the answer correct to at least 2 decimal places, and the correct answer is 5.2689 (to 4 decimal places), then all of these answers are correct: 5.2689, 5.269, 5.27. In contrast, the following answers would be incorrect: 5.26 (because this has been rounded to 2 decimal places incorrectly), 5.2, 5.3 (because these answers do not contain sufficient decimal places). Note that the decimal point must be a period (.) not a comma (,). Do NOT enter white-space characters in the answer boxes.
