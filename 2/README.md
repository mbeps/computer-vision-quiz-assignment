**Colour Opponent Cells**

For this exercise, use the **rooster image** converted from **uint8** to **double** format. Simulate the response of **blue-off, yellow-on colour-opponent cells** to all different parts of the rooster image. The Gaussian used to simulate both the centre and surround should have a standard deviation of **2.75**. Ensure that the simulated response is the same size as the input image. Show the result.

### **EXERCISE**

**Question 1**
For the simulated colour-opponent cells, report the output at the following location in the image (correct to at least 2 decimal places):
Row = 184, Column = 15

**Question 2**
For the simulated colour-opponent cells, report the output at the following location in the image (correct to at least 2 decimal places):
Row = 133, Column = 293
